Part 1 - QUESTIONS:
1. Why OSPF is more suitable than RIP for this network topology?
For this topology with multiple routers, redundant paths, ISP connectivity, and growth potential, OSPF is clearly superior to RIP in performance, reliability, and scalability.

2. Why the passive interfaces should be configured and what problem do they prevent?
Passive interfaces are configured to stop routing protocol updates from being sent out user-facing or unnecessary interfaces.

3. How the ROUTER ID is selected on your routers?
The Router ID is chosen when the OSPF process starts and does not change unless OSPF is restarted or the RID is manually set.

4. Why does OSPF use LSAa instead of sending full routing tables?
OSPF uses LSAs instead of full routing tables to reduce bandwidth usage and improve scalability.

5. What happens when you change the OSPF priority on an interface?
Changing the OSPF priority on an interface affects the router’s eligibility to become the DR (Designated Router) or BDR (Backup DR) on that network.

6. What would happen if Area 10 were configured as a stub area?
If Area 10 is configured as a stub area, it cannot receive external (Type 5) LSAs from outside the OSPF autonomous system.

7. How is the default route advertised in OSPF, and where is it visible?
In OSPF, the default route is advertised using a Type 3 summary LSA with a 0.0.0.0/0 prefix. It is visible only inside the area that receives the advertisement, such as stub or NSSA areas.
