1. Why is NAT required in IPv4 networks?
Because in the real world we are out of ipv4 addresses and every host cant have their public ip address not like if we would use ipv6.

2. What is the difference between inside local and inside global addresses?
Inside local - Is a privat ip of the hosts, mostly in 192.168.0.0/16 range
Inside global - Your public IP, which is the ip that the outside packet will have as a source

3. Why is PAT more scalable than static NAT?
If we use NAT it uses a 1-1 translation, not really solve the problem of ip outage. If we use PAT every host will use the same inside global ip with different source port numbers

4. What happens if the NAT table becomes full?
The new translations wont be translated

5. Why is a standard ACL sufficient for defining NAT sources?
Becouse we just define the source which to be translated.

6. Can NAT be considered a security mechanism? Why or why not?
Yes, it can hide your local inside ip address, and the ip address structure of the local network

7. Why is static NAT typically combined with ACLs or firewalls?
It mostly for to get a server publicly available. In most cases we dont want the public to access all ports of the server
