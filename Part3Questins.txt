1. Why is a standard ACL sufficient for VTY protection?
Because we just filters the source, on the vty lines the destination will always be the remote access of the device.

2. Why should extended ACLs be placed closest to the source?
To not waste resources on routing a packet that will be droped latley

3. What happens if the implicit deny any is not considered?
The matches wont be shown in the statistics

4. Why is ICMP sometimes allowed even in restrictive ACLs?
To ensure the natwork is working.

5. What is the difference between applying an ACL to:
 -an interface
 -VTY lines

On interface we filter traffic from anywhere to anywhere,
On VTY lines we filter traffic with the destination of the routers remote access

6. How does ACL logging help during troubleshooting?
We can track where is our packet is get stuck.

7. What security risks exist if outside-in ACLs are not configured?
Every traffic can get into my network and access any host of it.
